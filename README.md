# Functional Quality Software

## Introduction

Functional Quality Software (fqs), a nameplay to Berkeley Quality Software (see The Hacker's Dictionary by Eric S Raymond) is a Julia package that tries to imitate what Statistical Parametric Mapping ([SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)) does! 

It came out of frustration of the existance of a similar package for functional neuroscience in Julia! 

##Â WIP 

It is obviously work in progress (continuously).
