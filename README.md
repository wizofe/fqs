# Functional Quality Software

## Introduction

Functional Quality Software (`fqs` pronounced "fuck's", as in the phrase "for fuck's sake, Julia!"). It's a double nameplay to Berkeley Quality Software (see The Hacker's Dictionary by Eric S Raymond) 

In all seriousness though, it is a Julia package that tries to imitate (well obviously in a limited feature set and only the features which I need) what Statistical Parametric Mapping ([SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)) does! 

It came out of frustration of the existence of a similar package for functional neuroscience in Julia! 

##Â WIP 

It is obviously work in progress (continuously).
